# Battery Passport - Lifecycle Carbon Footprint Calculation of EV Batteries


As the global demand for electric vehicles (EVs) continues to rise, it is essential to understand the environmental impact of EV batteries. The European Union's Battery Regulation mandates that by February 2027, all EV batteries must feature a unique digital passport that tracks their environmental impact, including carbon footprint data. Existing initiatives, such as the Battery Pass project, focus on standardizing content requirements and establishing methodologies for lifecycle assessments. This project aims to build upon these efforts by specifically addressing carbon footprint calculations to enhance transparency, guide consumers, and inform policymakers while promoting sustainable practices within the battery supply chain.


The goal of this project is to develop a robust methodology for calculating the carbon footprint of EV batteries throughout their entire lifecycle. This will provide stakeholders with detailed insights into carbon emissions associated with each stage of battery production and usage. Additionally, the project aims to identify opportunities for enhancing recycling rates and reducing overall emissions through better design and material choices.


To achieve this, I will first conduct a comprehensive review of existing studies and methodologies related to lifecycle assessment (LCA) and carbon footprint calculations for batteries. Following this, I will develop a framework in consultation with industry experts that encompasses raw material extraction, manufacturing, usage, and end-of-life stages. After conducting the necessary analysis and review, I intend to share the findings through a detailed report and presentation.
